This is a temporary repository for submitting IVDC's automathon problem statement. For the detailed approach to this problem kindly check the .docx file. Since the majority of files were from YOLOR, I have added the other files to this through links.

Run the YOLOR program in Google Colab with GPU enabled : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YJxs_VfRYqO7lfPn7HyPNhRzJv3knNoM#scrollTo=4-DNbeQV85N4


Lane Detection has been done using OpenCV so it can be run anywhere even if it is simply downloaded [A seperate repository has been made for it here : https://github.com/thugunb/Lane-Detection-using-OpenCV]


Object Tracking will not run completely but that is also provided in Google Colab : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w5NRxlnc41wU4bpvGleHVDjf0i7jF4fk
